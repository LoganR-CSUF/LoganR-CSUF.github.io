## CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    My first favorite Lab is Lab 6. I enjoyed this lab because this was a real look into the command line arguments to make a game of black jack. It was also the first Lab the really made me think logically about the solution. 

* Lab 8

    I liked this lab for much the same reasons I liked lab 6, it was very stimulating in implementing the lab. And the feeling of making a program accept command line inputs is very satisfying. However the second poart was my favorite, having to do nested for loops was very interesting.

* Lab 10

    This one was my all-time favorite lab of the twelve. I liked having to read the data from a file in order to parse it. It makes me feel like Iâ€™ve dipped my toes into the world of programming.
